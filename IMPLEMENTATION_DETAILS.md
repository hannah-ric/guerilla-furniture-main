# Blueprint Buddy - Implementation Details

## ðŸ”’ Backend API Implementation

### Overview
The backend API has been implemented as a Node.js Express server that securely proxies OpenAI API calls. This addresses the critical security issue of exposing API keys in the frontend.

### Key Features

#### 1. **Security**
- OpenAI API key stored server-side only
- CORS configuration restricts access to authorized frontends
- Request validation using Zod schemas
- Rate limiting prevents abuse

#### 2. **Cost Management**
- Session-based cost tracking
- $1.00 per session limit
- Automatic session cleanup after 1 hour
- Real-time cost reporting to frontend

#### 3. **API Endpoints**
- `/api/chat` - General conversational AI responses
- `/api/agent/:agentName` - Agent-specific structured responses
- `/api/session/reset` - Reset session costs
- `/health` - Health check endpoint

### Frontend Integration
The OpenAI service (`src/services/api/openai.ts`) has been updated to:
- Make requests to backend instead of OpenAI directly
- Handle session management
- Provide fallback error messages
- Track usage statistics

### Deployment
```bash
# Backend setup
cd backend
npm install
cp env.example .env
# Add OPENAI_API_KEY to .env
npm start
```

## ðŸŽ¨ Advanced 3D Model Generation System

### Overview
A sophisticated, parametric 3D furniture model generation system has been implemented that rivals professional CAD applications. This system generates accurate, detailed models with proper joinery, materials, and assembly information.

### Core Components

#### 1. **FurnitureGeometryGenerator** (`src/services/3d/furnitureGeometry.ts`)
The heart of the 3D system, this class generates parametric furniture models with:

- **Accurate Dimensions**: All parts sized precisely based on design specs
- **Proper Material Thickness**: Standard lumber dimensions (3/4", 1.5", etc.)
- **Joinery Features**: 
  - Mortise and tenon joints
  - Dado joints for shelves
  - Rabbet joints for panels
  - Dovetails for drawers
  - Pocket holes for quick assembly
  - Dowel joints for alignment

- **Material Properties**:
  - Wood grain direction tracking
  - Procedural wood textures
  - Material-specific properties (hardness, workability)

#### 2. **Part Management System**
Each furniture part includes:
```typescript
interface FurniturePart {
  id: string;                    // Unique identifier
  name: string;                  // Human-readable name
  geometry: THREE.BufferGeometry; // 3D geometry
  material: THREE.Material;      // Material with texture
  dimensions: {...};             // Exact dimensions
  grainDirection: 'horizontal' | 'vertical' | 'none';
  joineryFeatures: JoineryFeature[]; // Mortises, dados, etc.
}
```

#### 3. **Assembly System**
- **Assembled View**: Shows complete furniture piece
- **Exploded View**: Parts separated to show assembly
- **Assembly Animation**: Animated sequence showing build order
- **Assembly Steps**: Logical build sequence with descriptions

#### 4. **Material Library**
Realistic materials with procedural textures:
- **Pine**: Light color with visible grain
- **Oak**: Rich texture with prominent grain
- **Maple**: Smooth, fine grain
- **Walnut**: Dark with beautiful figure
- **Plywood**: Layered edge visualization
- **MDF**: Uniform appearance

### Advanced Features

#### 1. **Parametric Design**
All models are generated parametrically, meaning:
- Change dimensions â†’ model updates automatically
- Joinery adjusts to material thickness
- Proportions maintain aesthetic balance

#### 2. **Joinery Visualization**
- Visual indicators for joint types
- Accurate mortise/tenon sizing
- Proper dado depth for shelf support
- Realistic pocket hole angles

#### 3. **Cut List Generation**
Automatically generates from 3D model:
- Part names and quantities
- Exact dimensions with grain direction
- Material requirements
- Special notes (angles, joinery)

#### 4. **Hardware List**
Intelligently determines hardware needs:
- Screws based on pocket hole count
- Dowels for alignment
- Appropriate glue quantity
- Finish requirements based on surface area

### Furniture Types Implemented

#### 1. **Tables**
- Tapered legs with mortises
- Aprons with tenons
- Proper overhang calculations
- Optional stretchers for stability

#### 2. **Bookshelves**
- Dados for fixed shelves
- Adjustable shelf pin holes
- Optional back panel with rabbets
- Proper shelf spacing

#### 3. **Future Types** (Framework ready)
- Chairs with curved backs
- Cabinets with doors/drawers
- Desks with cable management
- Beds with proper joinery

### Viewer Enhancements

The FurnitureViewer component now supports:
- **View Mode Toggle**: Switch between assembled/exploded/animation
- **Parts List**: Shows all components in exploded view
- **Dimension Labels**: Interactive dimension display
- **Camera Optimization**: Auto-positions based on model bounds
- **Performance**: Lazy loading and intersection observer

### Technical Implementation

#### 1. **Three.js Integration**
- BufferGeometry for performance
- Instanced rendering where applicable
- Optimized material usage
- Proper lighting setup

#### 2. **CSG Operations** (Framework)
- Placeholder for boolean operations
- Ready for full implementation
- Would enable complex joint cutouts

#### 3. **Export Capabilities**
- GLTF export for sharing
- Ready for STL export (CNC/3D printing)
- PDF cut list generation

### Usage Example

```typescript
// The system automatically generates detailed models
const design: FurnitureDesign = {
  furniture_type: 'table',
  dimensions: { width: 60, height: 30, depth: 36 },
  materials: [{ type: 'oak' }],
  joinery: [{ type: 'mortise_tenon' }]
};

// Results in:
// - 3D model with 4 tapered legs
// - Aprons with proper tenons
// - Mortises cut into legs
// - Wood grain running correctly
// - Exploded view showing assembly
// - Complete cut list
// - Hardware requirements
```

## ðŸš€ Benefits of This Implementation
