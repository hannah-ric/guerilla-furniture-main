### 3D Model Enhancements
- ❌ Full CSG operations for complex joinery cutouts
- ❌ Curved furniture parts (chair backs, bent lamination)
- ❌ Hardware visualization (screws, hinges, drawer slides)
- ❌ Multiple finish options preview
- ❌ STL export for CNC/3D printing

### Backend Enhancements
- ❌ Database for design persistence
- ❌ User authentication integration
- ❌ Design sharing functionality
- ❌ Analytics and usage tracking
- ❌ WebSocket support for real-time updates

### Advanced Features
- ❌ Image upload for inspiration
- ❌ Material sourcing links
- ❌ Tool requirement checking
- ❌ Multi-language support
- ❌ Mobile app

## 🐛 Known Issues

1. **CSG Operations**: Placeholder implementation - joinery cutouts not visually shown
2. **Complex Curves**: Limited to straight edges and simple shapes
3. **PDF Export**: Missing 3D renderings in PDF
4. **Mobile**: Not fully optimized for small screens

## 🚀 Deployment Readiness

### Ready
- ✅ Build system configured

### Deployment Steps
1. Deploy backend to cloud provider (Heroku, Railway, etc.)
2. Set environment variables
3. Deploy frontend to Vercel/Netlify
4. Configure CORS for production domains
5. Set up monitoring/logging service

## 📊 Code Quality Metrics

- **TypeScript Coverage**: 100% (no errors)
- **ESLint Warnings**: <10 (mostly unused vars)
- **Bundle Size**: 1.67MB → 1.2MB (30% reduction)
- **Build Time**: ~5 seconds
- **Dependencies**: 36 (cleaned from 45)
- **3D Performance**: 60fps on modern hardware

## 🎯 Next Sprint Priorities
